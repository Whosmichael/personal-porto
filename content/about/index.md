My name is Michael Baptiswa Marully. I'm a penultimate year student majoring in information systems.

Highly motivated and eager to learn new skills, specifically on product management, business analysis, and data analysis.

Through some competition that I took part in, I got a lot of insights and knowledge on business and product design.

Here are a few of my interests!
